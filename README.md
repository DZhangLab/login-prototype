# Login-prototype

## ** Important notice !!! **
Due to technical issues, I switched back to MongoDB instead of MySQL. If when ever is needed to switch back, the code can be found on the commit on Mar-30-2022. The only issue is the passportjs with SQL and 2fa cannot be setup properly. Without passportjs, the code is running fine. The facebook and google Oauth do not have any problems. Their authentication is working properly. 

This is the repo for login prototype. The project is created by Minghao Zhao.

The language used in this project is node.js.
There is a User interface includes pages: home, login, signup, 2fa, and content. The content page will be replaced with the actual Healthcare Block Chain.
The project is connected to a MySQL database to store the user information. As right now, it is only connected to a local database. In the end, the server should connect to cloud database to store the information.
